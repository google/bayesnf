Spatially referenced time series (i.e., spatiotemporal) datasets are
ubiquitous in scientific, engineering, and business-intelligence
applications. This repository contains an implementation of the Bayesian
Neural Field (BayesNF) a novel spatiotemporal modeling method that
integrates hierarchical probabilistic modeling for accurate uncertainty
estimation with deep neural networks for high-capacity function
approximation.

Bayesian Neural Fields infer joint probability distributions over field
values at arbitrary points in time and space, which makes the model
suitable for many data-analysis tasks including spatial interpolation,
temporal forecasting, and variography. Posterior inference is conducted
using variationally learned surrogates trained via mini-batch stochastic
gradient descent for handling large-scale data.

## Installation

`bayesnf` can be installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using:

```
python -m pip install .
```

Typical install time is 1 minute. The direct dependencies are shown
in the [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml#L18-L26) file.

This software is tested on Python 3.9.
Experiments were run using TPU accelerators.
